### What is InstaPay?
InstaPay lets businesses create a mobile bill and send them to customers through SMS or some other communication channels. Customers can open the mobile bill and choose a method of payment from a range of payment methods available and instantly pay on the go. The solution is hosted in a secure PCI-DSS certified environment.

### Philosophy:
InstaPay is intended to let businesses push a payment bill to customers. The end users should easily
be able to choose their preferred way of paying and through as few steps as possible, pay on the go. InstaPay makes this easy
and handles integrations with payment providers and simplifies the settlement by easy reporting. 

### What is this used for?

InstaPay can also be used for charity to raise funds, tickets, permits, store card profiles for recurring payments, membership and much more. Among our clients you find insurance-, utility companies, banks, charity organizations and ERP companies.

*Supported payment channels:*  Debit- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard), Vipps, Strex
